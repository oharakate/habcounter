# This is Kate's jotter for doing the packaging things in.

# Some useful keyboard shortcuts for package authoring:
#
#   Install Package:           'Ctrl + Shift + B'
#   Check Package:             'Ctrl + Shift + E'
#   Test Package:              'Ctrl + Shift + T'

# We will probably change the name of this package at some point.
# This website might help with that:

# I previously worked through this:
